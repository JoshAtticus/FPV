# FPV
FPV is a camera app for the Quest 3 (and possibly the Quest 3s, but this is untested! Please open an issue if you've tested it on a Quest 3s). 

It uses the CameraX library for simplicity, supporting both the left and right rear cameras and the Meta Avatar camera.

Heavily work in progress, but mostly functional :)
